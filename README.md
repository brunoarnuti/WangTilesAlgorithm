📖 Wang Tile Algorithm Visualization

Welcome to the Wang Tile Algorithm Visualization project! This repository showcases a Python implementation of the Wang Tile Algorithm using the Pygame library. This algorithm, named after its creator Wang, is a fascinating approach to generating visually appealing tile-based patterns.

👨‍🔬 Wang and the Algorithm

Wang Tile Algorithm, named after its inventor Hao Wang, is a tiling algorithm that involves creating complex patterns by assembling smaller square tiles. Hao Wang was a renowned mathematician and computer scientist who made significant contributions to the field of theoretical computer science. The algorithm he devised provides a method to generate intricate patterns by following a set of rules and constraints.

🔀 Implementation and Enhancements

In this project, we have taken the original Wang Tile Algorithm and implemented it using Python and Pygame. Our implementation goes beyond the basic functionality by adding additional features, such as the ability to create randomized patterns and incorporate squares of four tiles of the same type. By doing so, we aim to provide a more visually engaging and versatile experience.

💡 Tackling the Challenge

Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges and worked diligently to overcome them. One of the primary objectives was to ensure that the generated patterns adhere to the specified constraints, such as limiting the maximum number of consecutive identical tiles in a row or column. By iterating and fine-tuning our approach, we managed to strike a balance between randomness and constraint enforcement, resulting in visually captivating and rule-compliant patterns.
