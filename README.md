## Wang Tiles Visualizer

Welcome to the Wang Tiles Visualizer! This repository is a tribute to the brilliant work of mathematician, logician, and philosopher Hao Wang. His creation, the Wang tiles, introduced in 1961, is an intriguing system of multi-colored square tiles. It finds a sweet spot in the realm of computer graphics, most prominently in procedural texture generation and the creation of seamlessly tiled patterns for 2D game worlds. üéÆüåç

This repo hosts two intriguing Python implementations, based on Pygame, of Wang tileset generation and visualization.

### Wang Tiles - A Primer üß©

Wang Tiles are a class of formal systems. They're square tiles with a color assigned to each edge. The challenge lies in arranging them on a grid such that the colors of the touching edges of any two tiles always match. Wang proposed that if a set of tiles can tile the plane, it can do so periodically. However, this claim, known as Wang's conjecture, was later disproved.

These tiles have found various applications in computer science, especially in computer graphics and procedural generation of images. For instance, in creating diverse, yet coherent, tile-based 2D world maps for games.

### Our Implementations üíª

#### Block Pattern Wang Tiles üí†
The first implementation uses a custom set of rules to create large blocks of tiles. Each tile (represented by 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D') has a designated color. The placement rules ensure that each tile only connects with specific other tiles, maintaining the seamless nature of the grid. If we were using tillable textures for A, B, C and D, themselves, large blocks of the same texture would make sense since it would be like a patch of the same tile, but not for the same tile for the entire map.

#### Stochastic Wang Tiles üé≤

While the first implementation yielded visually pleasing results, I observed the patterns became too predictable over time. Real-world patterns have a degree of randomness that was missing in the large blocks.

### Stochastic Wang Tiles - Adding a Dash of Randomness üé≤

It introduces an element of stochasticity to the Wang Tiles, making the output less predictable and more varied. We devised a modified set of Wang tile rules, but this time with a twist: there's a small chance of breaking these rules!

This chance factor results in occasional repeating tiles and 2x2 squares of the same tile type, adding more diversity to the grid patterns and a bit more life to the tile world.

This stochastic approach is highly beneficial in scenarios where a bit of randomness can lead to more natural-looking results, such as terrain generation in video games.

### Journey to the Algorithm üõ§Ô∏è

The journey started with a curiosity about the Wang tiles and how we could visualize them in a creative and fun manner. After understanding the core concepts, we set out to implement the Wang tiling rules in Python. We decided to utilize Pygame for visual representation and added our unique set of rules for the placement of tiles.

### Why I found this algorithm and for what purpose?

Here's how the quest for seamless, diverse game backgrounds led me to the Wang Tiles Algorithm.

With four distinct, tileable textures (A, B, C, D) I created from Midjourney in hand, I was determined to create an engaging environment for my RTS prototype game. However, connecting them seamlessly and avoiding unwanted patterns, like large squares or more than two consecutive same textures, required a smart, algorithmic solution.

Here are the 4 distinct textures that insired me to find that algorithmic solution.
